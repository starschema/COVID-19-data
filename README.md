The following script takes data from the repository of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). It will apply necessary cleansing/reformatting to make it use in traditional relational databases and data visualization tools.

## Real-time data, easy to work with

Johns Hopkins University has taken the lead in compiling data in real-time and making it available to the public. Now through this JHU Coronavirus Data Stream weâ€™ve made that real-time data easy to access and analyze alongside other data sources as it updates.

As a contribution by [Starschema](https://starschema.com) to global data-driven efforts to combat COVID-19, we are making this data available in a standardized format with an automated refresh. This single source easily blends with other data sources so you can analyze the movement of the disease over time, in any context.

## Technical details

The JHU Coronavirus Data Stream includes reported cases at the province level in China, country/province/state level in the US, Australia and Canada, and at the country level otherwise. Drawing from the JHU CSSE github repository, this cleaned (ISO-8601 date format), unioned & unpivoted dataset is updated hourly. Full information on the data sources available: https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/.


### Outputs

Raw data is available through a range of availabilities.

#### Snowflake Data Exchange

The COVID-19 data set is available on [Snowflake Data Exchange](https://www.snowflake.com/datasets/starschema/). This data set is continuously refreshed.

The schema of the tables in Snowflake Data Exchange is detailed [in the wiki](https://github.com/starschema/COVID-19-data/wiki/Snowflake-Data-Exchange-schema).

#### S3 raw CSVs

Raw CSV files are available on AWS S3:

* [`CT_US_COVID_TESTS.csv`: COVID-19 tests performed in the US, by date](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/starschema.covid/CT_US_COVID_TESTS.csv)
* [`JHU_COVID-19.csv`: COVID-19 case counts, by date, country and case type](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/starschema.covid/JHU_COVID-19.csv)
* [`KFF_HCP_capacity.csv`: healthcare provider capacity, by state, 2018](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/starschema.covid/KFF_HCP_capacity.csv) (from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation)
* [`KFF_US_POLICY_ACTIONS.csv`: US policy actions, by state, current](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/starschema.covid/KFF_US_POLICY_ACTIONS.csv) (from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation)

#### Tableau Web Data Connector

There is a [Tableau Web Data Connector](https://starschema-extensions.s3.amazonaws.com/covid-tableau-online-wdc/index.html) available for your use in Tableau to integrate the COVID-19 data set into your dashboards and analytical applications. Currently, this supports the JHU CSSE data set and the Italian case counts released by the Dipartimento delle Protezione Civile.


### Transformations

All applied transformation sets are documented in the `Jupyter` notebook: https://github.com/starschema/COVID-19-data/blob/master/notebooks/JHU_COVID-19.ipynb
