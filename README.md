This data set collates a growing number of critical indicators for assessment, monitoring and forecasting of the global COVID-19 situation. The data set is maintained by [Starschema](https://starschema.com), an international data services consultancy.

## Real-time data, easy to work with

A range of data sets have been published that are useful for monitoring and understanding the spread of COVID-19. Our efforts are intended to **collate, curate and unify** the most valuable data sources for enterprises, individuals and public health experts to assess the situation and make data-driven decisions. This single source easily blends with other data sources so you can analyze the movement of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic over time, in any context.

## Technical details

### Conventions

By convention, we unify geographies to ISO-3166-1 and ISO-3166-2 alpha-2 identifiers. We use `pycountry`'s country definitions and mappings.

### Outputs

Raw data is available through a range of availabilities.

#### Snowflake Data Exchange

The COVID-19 data set is available on [Snowflake Data Exchange](https://www.snowflake.com/datasets/starschema/). This data set is continuously refreshed.

You can use the `METADATA` table for metadata about each table, on a column level. Where the column is not specified, information pertains to the entire table.

#### S3 raw CSVs

Raw CSV files are available on AWS S3:

#### Tableau Web Data Connector

There is a [Tableau Web Data Connector](https://starschema-extensions.s3.amazonaws.com/covid-tableau-online-wdc/index.html) available for your use in Tableau to integrate the COVID-19 data set into your dashboards and analytical applications. Currently, this supports the JHU CSSE data set and the Italian case counts released by the Dipartimento delle Protezione Civile.


### Transformations

All applied transformation sets are documented in the `Jupyter` notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder.
